Links to slide decks and information about the lectorials will appear below.

## Lectorial A: Robotic Vision
Presented by Peter Corke, Queensland University of Technology, and Donald G. Dansereau, University of Sydney

### A: Introduction to Robotic Vision
A general introduction and motivation about the important/elegance/power of vision as a sensor, and why robots need it.

### A1: Introduction To Image Processing (Peter Corke)
Pixels, images, image processing, feature extraction.

#### Coding Session:
* [Image features](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Tobias-Fischer/RVSS/blob/main/Robotic_Vision/image_features.ipynb)
* [Finding blobs](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Tobias-Fischer/RVSS/blob/main/Robotic_Vision/finding-blobs.ipynb)

#### Supporting Resources:
The following chapters from the [Robotics, Vision and Control](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-54413-7) Textbook support this session:
* Chapters 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4 and 12.5
* Chapter 13.1
  * Those who are a bit rusty on homogenous transformation matrices, rotation matrices and similar concepts may find Chapters 2.1 and 2.2 - 2D and 3D Geometry useful.

The following masterclasses from the [QUT Robot Academy](https://robotacademy.net.au/) may also be used to help develop your knowledge:
* [Introduction to Robotic Vision](https://robotacademy.net.au/masterclass/robotic-vision/)
* [2D Geometry](https://robotacademy.net.au/masterclass/2d-geometry/) and [3D Geometry](https://robotacademy.net.au/masterclass/3d-geometry/)
* [Getting Images into a Computer](https://robotacademy.net.au/masterclass/getting-images-into-a-computer/)
* [Image Processing](https://robotacademy.net.au/masterclass/image-processing/)
* [Spatial Operators](https://robotacademy.net.au/masterclass/spatial-operators/)
* [Feature Extraction](https://robotacademy.net.au/masterclass/feature-extraction/)

### A2: Introduction to Visual Geometry (Donald Dansereau & Peter Corke)
From light to digital images, the front end of the robotic vision process.

#### Coding Session:
* [Camera projection basics](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Tobias-Fischer/RVSS/blob/main/Robotic_Vision/camera_animation.ipynb)
* [Camera modeling](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Tobias-Fischer/RVSS/blob/main/Robotic_Vision/camera.ipynb)
* [Camera calibration](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Tobias-Fischer/RVSS2022/blob/main/Robotic_Vision/calibration.ipynb)
* [Fiducial makers (AprilTags and ArUco markers)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Tobias-Fischer/RVSS2022/blob/main/Robotic_Vision/fiducuals.ipynb)

#### Supporting Resources:
The following chapters from the [Robotics, Vision and Control](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-54413-7) Textbook support this session:
* Chapters 11.1 and 11.2

The following masterclasses from the [QUT Robot Academy](https://robotacademy.net.au/) may also be used to help develop your knowledge:
* [How Are Images Formed](https://robotacademy.net.au/masterclass/how-images-are-formed/)
* [The Geometry of Image Formation](https://robotacademy.net.au/masterclass/the-geometry-of-image-formation/) 
  * You may find watching [3D Geometry](https://robotacademy.net.au/masterclass/3d-geometry/) prior to these two will be beneficial
